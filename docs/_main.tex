% John commented this file extensively, so read through to see how to use the various options.  Remember that in LaTeX,
% any line starting with a % is NOT executed.  Several places below, you have a choice of which line to use
% out of multiple options (eg draft vs final, for PDF vs for binding, etc.)  When you pick one, add a % to the beginning of
% the lines you don't want.


%%%%% PAGE LAYOUT
% The most common choices should be below.  You can also do other things, like replacing "a4paper" with "letterpaper", etc.

% This one formats for two-sided binding (ie left and right pages have mirror margins; blank pages inserted where needed):
%\documentclass[a4paper,twoside]{templates/ociamthesis}
% This one formats for one-sided binding (ie left margin > right margin; no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper]{ociamthesis}
% This one formats for PDF output (ie equal margins, no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper,nobind]{templates/ociamthesis}

% As you can see from the uncommented line below, oxforddown template uses the a4paper size, 
% and passes in the binding option from the YAML header in index.Rmd:
\documentclass[a4paper, nobind]{templates/curtinthesis}


%%%%% ADDING LATEX PACKAGES
% add hyperref package with options from YAML %
\usepackage[pdfpagelabels]{hyperref}
% handle long urls
\usepackage{xurl}
% change the default coloring of links to something sensible
\usepackage{xcolor}

\definecolor{mylinkcolor}{RGB}{0,0,139}
\definecolor{myurlcolor}{RGB}{0,0,139}
\definecolor{mycitecolor}{RGB}{0,33,71}

\hypersetup{
  hidelinks,
  colorlinks,
  linktocpage=true,
  linkcolor=mylinkcolor,
  urlcolor=myurlcolor,
  citecolor=mycitecolor
}



% add float package to allow manual control of figure positioning %
\usepackage{float}

% enable strikethrough
\usepackage[normalem]{ulem}

% use soul package for correction highlighting
\usepackage{color, soulutf8}
\definecolor{correctioncolor}{HTML}{CCCCFF}

%%%%% FIXING / ADDING THINGS THAT'S SPECIAL TO R MARKDOWN'S USE OF LATEX TEMPLATES
% pandoc puts lists in 'tightlist' command when no space between bullet points in Rmd file,
% so we add this command to the template
\providecommand{\tightlist}{%
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}}

%UL set section header spacing

%%%%% SELECT YOUR DRAFT OPTIONS
% This adds a "DRAFT" footer to every normal page.  (The first page of each chapter is not a "normal" page.)

% IP feb 2021: option to include line numbers in PDF

% for line wrapping in code blocks
\usepackage{fancyvrb}
\usepackage{fvextra}
\DefineVerbatimEnvironment{Highlighting}{Verbatim}{breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true, commandchars=\\\{\}}

% This highlights (in blue) corrections marked with (for words) \mccorrect{blah} or (for whole
% paragraphs) \begin{mccorrection} . . . \end{mccorrection}.  This can be useful for sending a PDF of
% your corrected thesis to your examiners for review.  Turn it off, and the blue disappears.
\correctionstrue


%%%%% BIBLIOGRAPHY SETUP
% Note that your bibliography will require some tweaking depending on your department, preferred format, etc.
% If you've not used LaTeX before, I recommend reading a little about biblatex/biber and getting started with it.
% If you're already a LaTeX pro and are used to natbib or something, modify as necessary.
% Either way, you'll have to choose and configure an appropriate bibliography format...

% this enables pandoc citations
\newlength{\cslhangindent}
\setlength{\cslhangindent}{1.5em}

\setlength{\csllabelwidth}{3em}

\newcommand{\university}{Curtin University}
\newcommand{\submittedtext}{This thesis is presented for the Degree of}
\newcommand\degree{Doctor of Philosophy}
\newcommand\submissiondate{\today}


%%%%% YOUR OWN PERSONAL MACROS
% This is a good place to dump your own LaTeX macros as they come up.

% To make text superscripts shortcuts
	\renewcommand{\th}{\textsuperscript{th}} % ex: I won 4\th place
	\newcommand{\nd}{\textsuperscript{nd}}
	\renewcommand{\st}{\textsuperscript{st}}
	\newcommand{\rd}{\textsuperscript{rd}}

%%%%% THE ACTUAL DOCUMENT STARTS HERE
\begin{document}

%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR SECTION NUMBERING DEPTH HERE
% You have two choices.  First, how far down are sections numbered?  (Below that, they're named but
% don't get numbers.)  Second, what level of section appears in the table of contents?  These don't have
% to match: you can have numbered sections that don't show up in the ToC, or unnumbered sections that
% do.  Throughout, 0 = chapter; 1 = section; 2 = subsection; 3 = subsubsection, 4 = paragraph...

% The level that gets a number:
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{2}
% The level that shows up in the ToC:
\setcounter{tocdepth}{1}

% JEM: Pages are roman numbered from here, though page numbers are invisible until ToC.  This is in
% keeping with most typesetting conventions.

\adjustmtc
\markboth{Introduction}{}

Welcome to \texttt{oxforddown} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-lyngsOxforddown2019}{Lyngs, 2019}), a thesis template for R Markdown that I created when writing \href{https://ulyngs.github.io/phd-thesis/}{my own PhD thesis} at the University of Oxford.
This template allows you to write in R Markdown, while formatting the PDF output with the beautiful and time-tested \href{https://github.com/mcmanigle/OxThesis}{OxThesis LaTeX template}.
The sample content is partly adapted from \href{https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown}{\texttt{thesisdown}} .

Hopefully, writing your thesis in R Markdown will provide a nicer interface to the OxThesis template if you haven't used TeX or LaTeX before.
More importantly, \emph{R Markdown} allows you to embed chunks of code within your thesis and generate plots and tables directly from the underlying data, avoiding copy-paste steps.
This gets you into the habit of doing reproducible research, which will benefit you long-term as a researcher, and also help anyone that is trying to reproduce or build upon your results down the road.

\hypertarget{why-use-it}{%
\section*{Why use it?}\label{why-use-it}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Why use it?}

\emph{R Markdown} creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the beauty of LaTeX.
Packages have been written in \textbf{R} to work directly with LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs.
In addition to creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX, \emph{R Markdown} allows you to read in your data, analyze it and to visualize it using \textbf{R}, \textbf{Python} or other languages, and provide documentation and commentary on the results of your project.\\
Further, it allows for results of code output to be passed inline to the commentary of your results.
You'll see more on this later, focusing on \textbf{R}.
If you are more into \textbf{Python} or something else, you can still use \emph{R Markdown} - see \href{https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html}{`Other language engines'} in Yihui Xie's \href{https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html}{\emph{R Markdown: The Definitive Guide}}.

Using LaTeX together with \emph{Markdown} is more consistent than the output of a word processor, much less prone to corruption or crashing, and the resulting file is smaller than a Word file.
While you may never have had problems using Word in the past, your thesis is likely going to be about twice as large and complex as anything you've written before, taxing Word's capabilities.

\hypertarget{who-should-use-it}{%
\section*{Who should use it?}\label{who-should-use-it}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Who should use it?}

Anyone who needs to use data analysis, math, tables, a lot of figures, complex cross-references, or who just cares about reproducibility in research can benefit from using \emph{R Markdown}.
If you are working in `softer' fields, the user-friendly nature of the \emph{Markdown} syntax and its ability to keep track of and easily include figures, automatically generate a table of contents, index, references, table of figures, etc. should still make it of great benefit to your thesis project.
