See the original README file in the ulyngs/oxforddown repository instructions. This fork contains only minor edits to adhere to the Curtin University PhD thesis style.

Main changes from original oxforddown:
* front-and-back-matter directory replaced with frontmatter directory which now only contains the frontmatter in various .tex files
